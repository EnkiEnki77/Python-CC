# To change the filepath in the terminal type cd filepath
# To see what folders/files exist within the current filepath type dir
# To execute a file in the terminal type python filename

# When an error occurs a traceback is output to the terminal.
# The first part tells you which file the error occured, as well as what line of the file. 
# The interpreter then gives a more specific hint toward what caused the error
# Lastly the error type is given, such as syntax error, name error, etc.

# A name error ususally means a value was not given to the variable, or we spelled the variable name wrong.

# Variables should not be looked at as storage for values, but as labels/names for that value, so that we have a way to 
# reference it.
