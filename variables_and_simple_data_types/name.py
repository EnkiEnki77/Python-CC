# The title string method converts a string to title case. Where the first letter of each word is uppcase, the rest are 
# lower. Its useful for when you want to format user input consistently the same way. So that input is case insensitive.

# A method is an action python can permorm on a piece of data. A method is a function.
# The dot tells the method to act on a certain variable. 

# Some other case methods are: 
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())

# The lower method is especially useful when storing data. You often dont want to trust a users casing on input. So you
# store it as lower case, and then use the appropriate case method when the time comes to display the data.
